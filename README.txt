This is a Python reverse shell for learning how to program network sockets. This was created after watching thenewboston and his tutorials. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ObzpG_W_0o

This is not that secure right now. Still working through everything. Hoping on creating some type of authentication and also creating an HTTPS reverse proxy. Seems to crash a lot and not be that smooth. I also need some kind of persistance and retrying of connections. 

Update 6/10/2019: Worked on multi-threaded handling. Next: Fix errors when issuing some commands like help cd
